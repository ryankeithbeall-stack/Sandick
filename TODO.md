# Sandick — Outstanding TODO

Status of the HIP-3 equal-weighted basket vault. What's **done** is tested
(205 Python + 44 contract tests); what's below is what remains before this can
hold real money, plus the product surface that doesn't exist yet.

## 1. Front-end UI — SCAFFOLDED (demo) 🟠
A sleek, zero-build front end now lives in [`frontend/`](frontend/) (hero with
the SANDICK image, basket overview, live equal-weight calculator, depositor app
and admin panel). It runs on a **local demo state machine** — no chain calls
yet. Remaining to make it live:

- [x] **Depositor app** UI: connect wallet, deposit USDC, view shares,
      NAV/share price, basket breakdown, redeem (sync) and the async queue
      (`requestRedeem` → status → `claim`). *(demo state — needs wiring)*
- [x] **Admin panel** UI: discover HIP-3 assets, build/adjust the basket,
      preview the equal-weight plan, submit basket, rebalance, bridge to/from
      Core. Gated to the manager/owner address. *(demo state — needs wiring)*
- [x] **Async-aware UX**: queue models "pending → claimable" on a delay rather
      than trusting an EVM receipt.
- [~] **Wire to chain**: config-gated live mode landed (`frontend/config.js`
      `chain.enabled`). Depositor path (connect, NAV/share reads, deposit,
      sync/async redeem, queue, claim), admin gating (manager/owner reads) and
      the safe admin writes (bridgeToCore/FromCore, pause/unpause, allow-list)
      now call the deployed vault via `chain.js` (viem). **Remaining:** browser
      encoding of `submitBasket`/`rebalance` orders — that belongs to the Python
      planner; the chain hook (`chain.submitBasket(orders)`) is ready to receive
      its output. Needs a deployed testnet vault to exercise end-to-end.
- [x] Stack decision (zero-build vanilla today; React + wagmi/viem on HyperEVM
      for the live wiring).

## 2. Testnet sign-off (chainid 998) 🔴
The architecture is simulation-tested only. Prove the live round-trip — a
step-by-step runbook for all of this now lives in
[`docs/testnet-signoff.md`](docs/testnet-signoff.md):

- [ ] Deploy via `sandick.deploy_config` + `scripts/deploy.js` to testnet.
- [ ] **Seed the vault's Core account** before opening deposits (fresh-account
      `accountMarginSummary` behavior must be confirmed — revert vs zeros).
- [ ] Confirm a **contract account can place HIP-3 orders via CoreWriter** on the
      Trade.xyz dex (the one medium-confidence assumption).
- [ ] Verify the calibrated immutables on-chain: `perpDexIndex`, each HIP-3
      `assetId`, USDC **system address** + token index, and **`coreScale`**
      (EVM↔Core decimals from `spotMeta`).
- [ ] End-to-end: deposit → bridgeToCore → submitBasket → NAV reflects equity →
      rebalance → requestRedeem → bridgeFromCore → fulfill → claim.
- [ ] Confirm the bridging flow (USDC EVM→spot→perp and back) and the
      start-of-block read timing against deposits/rebalances.

## 3. Security audit 🔴
- [ ] Full audit before any mainnet deposits (custody + share accounting +
      CoreWriter integration + redemption queue).
- [ ] Consider an independent review of the NAV-pricing path specifically
      (share price = on-chain reads; any manipulation = mispriced deposits).

## 4. Contract hardening 🟠
- [~] **NAV completeness**: `_coreSpotUsd()` hook is now folded into
      `totalAssets` (default 0); wiring the real spot-balance precompile so USDC
      parked in spot mid-bridge is counted remains.
- [x] **Pausability / circuit breaker** (owner pauses deposits/trading; exits
      stay open). `pause`/`unpause` in `BasketVaultBase`.
- [x] **Per-tx and per-epoch caps** on manager order notional (`setOrderCaps`).
- [x] **Redemption-liveness backstop**: `bridgeFromCoreForRedemptions` lets
      anyone pull USDC back from Core — but only up to the outstanding
      redemption deficit, and only once the manager has been silent for
      `managerTimeout` (default 7 days, owner-settable, 0 disables). Manager
      trades/bridges reset the countdown; the backstop never moves funds out of
      the vault. So a dark manager can delay exits but never trap them. Tested
      (5 contract tests; the EVM harness now supports a mutable clock).
- [~] Handle negative/under-water `accountValue` (reader clamps to 0); **stale
      reads** still need explicit handling.
- [x] Events/telemetry for every state transition (subgraph-friendly) — incl.
      `OrderCapsUpdated` + OZ `Paused`/`Unpaused`.

## 5. Operations / keeper 🟠
- [x] **Manager keeper bot**: pure decision logic in `sandick/keeper.py`,
      orchestration in `sandick/keeper_bot.py` (`KeeperBot.tick()` + `run_loop`
      scheduler — liquidity bridge-back + drift rebalance, dry-run by default,
      read→act→verify with retries), and the live web3 adapter
      `sandick/keeper_chain.py` (`Web3KeeperClient`: vault reads, `core_available`
      via the margin-summary precompile, manager-signed `bridgeFromCore` /
      `submitBasket`). All tested offline against a fake web3 (32 tests across
      both modules) plus an operator CLI `sandick/keeper_cli.py` (`sandick-keeper`:
      assembles weights/sizes from the basket + `assetId`s from `deploy.json`,
      preview-by-default, `--execute` to transmit). **Remaining (live-only):**
      verify `HyperliquidMarketData`'s positions parse for a HIP-3 dex on testnet,
      and run the loop against a node with the manager key
      (`pip install -e ".[keeper,live]"`).
- [~] **Verification reads**: `KeeperBot` re-reads idle USDC / position drift
      after each action and flags `UNVERIFIED` when state doesn't move (silent
      CoreWriter failure). Wiring the same confirm-by-read into the (off-chain)
      `exec_cli` submit path remains.
- [ ] Monitoring + alerting (NAV drift, failed actions, low buffer, drawdown).

## 6. Config / data 🟠
- [ ] Replace placeholder coin symbols (e.g. `KIOXIA`) and the `tradexyz` dex
      name with the **real Trade.xyz dex name + symbols** once known.
- [ ] Confirm the vault's EVM USDC token is 6-decimal (else adjust `coreScale`).

## 7. Engineering hygiene 🟢
- [x] CI: `ruff` + `pytest` (coverage-gated, py3.10–3.12) + `npm run
      test:contracts` + contract coverage on every push (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- [ ] Foundry test suite (mirrors the ethereumjs tests) for auditor familiarity.
- [ ] Fork/integration tests against a HyperEVM testnet fork if tooling allows.
- [x] Linting/formatting for Python (ruff, configured in `pyproject.toml`).
- [ ] Solidity formatting/linting (forge fmt / solhint).

## 8. Product / economics 🟢
- [x] Fee model: 2%/yr management + 10% performance (over a high-water mark) +
      0.1% exit, all charged as **dilution shares** to a treasury (exit fee
      retained in the vault) so the no-funds-out invariant holds. Owner-set with
      hard caps (`setFeeConfig`); accrues before every deposit/withdraw/queue
      action; `accrueFees()` poke. Tested (5 contract tests). **Note for audit:**
      performance fee keys off on-chain NAV — verify the read can't be transiently
      inflated to mint excess fee shares.
- [ ] Deposit caps / whitelisting if access control is wanted later.
- [x] Docs: depositor-facing explainer + risk disclosures (`docs/`).
